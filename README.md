The goal of this project is to practice all of the HTML knowledge acquired in the beginning lessons of The Odin Project's Foundations course. In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

This project is just to build HTML chops; this project will be revisited in the future to style it up with CSS.
