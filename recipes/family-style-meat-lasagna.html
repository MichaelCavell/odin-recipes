    <h2>Description</h2>
    <div class="recipe-description">
      <p>As winter’s chill takes hold, Trader Joe’s Family Style Meat Lasagna is here to answer the call for hearty, rib-sticking fare. Tender sheets of egg pasta are layered with creamy ricotta, tangy tomato sauce, and plenty of ground beef and pork seasoned with onion and garlic (the words “ultimate comfort food” would not be hyperbole here). Topped with an additional trifecta of cheeses—mozzarella, Romano, and Parmesan—the Lasagna is made fresh, then frozen and shipped to Trader Joe's, ready to report for “What’s for dinner?” duty. It reheats in about an hour in the oven, leaving you plenty of time to kick back with a glass of dry Chianti, and throw together a crunchy green salad with tangy vinaigrette to serve as a refreshing counterpoint to the Lasagna’s lusciously cheesy, marvelously meaty profile. (If you’re in a hurry, the microwave is an option, too!). </p>
      <p>What makes it Family Style? With a full two pounds of Meat Lasagna per tray, this impressively sized dish easily serves four hungry family members or guests.</p>
