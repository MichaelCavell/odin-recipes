    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Where do you go to get the best Burrito Bowl around? As of now, you head to Trader Joe's freezers. And where did Trader Joe's go to get that Burrito Bowl? Well, Canada, of course! They travel the world to find the best food and beverages, and sometimes they find them in the most unlikely places.</p>
    <p>So let's talk about Trader Joe's Chicken Burrito Bowl, shall we? It's a winner. Seasoned chicken breast, brown rice, red quinoa, black beans, corn, bell peppers, Cheddar cheese... this is a hearty bowl. Its Southwest style, smoky chipotle sauce marries all of those flavors and textures together and turns a bowl into a meal.</p>
    <p>With 22 grams of protein in every bowl, it's the real deal, satisfying and delicious. Stick a fork in it and you're done! Of course, you don't have to stick a fork in it. You could heat it and then load it into an actual burrito. Or tacos. Or you could scoop it onto a bed of greens and make a quickie southwest salad.</p>
